# Castles in Sweden
In this project, I tested creating a website for a castle in Sweden. I worked with the Google Maps API and a weather API from weatherapi.com. I used Tailwind CSS for the design. I haven't tried to hide the API keys in this project, and I have changed them. However, since this was just a frontend test to learn API calls and Tailwind CSS, I didn't build any backend to hide the API keys.
