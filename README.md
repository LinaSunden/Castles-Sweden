# castle Sweden
In this project I tested to do a website for Castle in Sweden.
I have worked with Google Maps api and a weather api from weatherapi.com.
I'll used Tailwindcss to set the design.
I haven't tried to hide the api-key in this project and I have changed them. But since this was 
just a test in frontend to learn api calls and Tailwindcss I didn't build any backend side to hide the api keys.
